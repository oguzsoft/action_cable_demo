# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
books = LibraryBook.create([{ title: 'Star Wars', status: 'on-shelf' }, { title: 'Lord of the Rings', status: 'on-shelf' }])
